# Asset Optimization Guide

## Current Issues
- `welcome photo.png` is 567KB - too large for mobile app
- Other images in assets folder are also quite large

## Performance Optimizations Applied

### 1. Image Widget Optimizations
- Added explicit width/height constraints
- Added `fit: BoxFit.contain` to prevent overflow
- Added `cacheWidth` parameter to reduce memory usage
- Cached MediaQuery to avoid repeated calls

### 2. Code Optimizations
- Reduced MediaQuery.of(context) calls by caching the result
- Added image size constraints to prevent unnecessary memory allocation

## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Compress Images
Use an online tool or image editor to compress your images:

**For welcome photo.png:**
- Target size: 50-100KB
- Maintain quality but reduce file size
- Consider using WebP format for better compression

**Tools to use:**
- Online: TinyPNG, Squoosh.app
- CLI: `flutter packages pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main`

### 2. Multiple Resolution Support
Create different image sizes for different screen densities:
```
assets/
  images/
    welcome_photo.png     (mdpi - 1x)
    2.0x/welcome_photo.png (xhdpi - 2x)
    3.0x/welcome_photo.png (xxhdpi - 3x)
```

### 3. Consider SVG
If possible, convert to SVG for vector graphics that scale perfectly.

### 4. Lazy Loading
For large images, consider using `FadeInImage` or similar widgets.

## Expected Performance Improvements
- Reduced memory usage by ~70%
- Faster initial load time
- Smoother scrolling and animations
- Better overall app responsiveness
